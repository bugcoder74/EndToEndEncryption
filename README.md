# EndToEndEncryption
After I developed the final version of my voting app at the mid of my class 11th, my motivation was on another level and I decided to develop something more complex and learn something new. So I built my own end-to-end encryption protocol - without using any default existing terminologies. 

As a blueprint of the simplest version of it, I collected each character from the string, and then generated a unique code for that character on a random basis. It was not a fixed length code - for example digits were encoded with 4 bit number while alphabets with 8 bit number. Also, since each encryption was made with unique code, it became hard to break the encryption system externally. Each encryption generated a unique key and only that unique key can be used to decrypt back the original text.
